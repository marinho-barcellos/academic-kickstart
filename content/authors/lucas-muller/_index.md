"I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Institute of Informatics, Brazil. During my doctoral studies, I also worked at the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis (CAIDA) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) under the supervision of Kc Claffy, Matthew Luckie, Bradley Huffaker, and Marinho Barcellos.

My work informs the design and implementation of systems via characterization and empirical evaluation of outcomes. Over the past nine years in academia, I have mentored, trained, and led many students and researchers to build and deploy systems to accomplish these goals. Besides, I have 10 years of experience with the software industry, where I led the development of innovative business projects and co-founded a startup."
