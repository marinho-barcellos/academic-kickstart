abstract: "Named Data Networking (NDN) is a novel architec- ture expected to overcome limitations of the current Internet. User mobility is one of the most relevant limitations to be addressed. NDN supports consumer mobility by design but fails to offer the same level of support for producer mobility. Existing approaches to extend NDN are host-centric, which conflicts with NDN principles, and provide limited support for producer mobility. This paper proposes a content-centric strategy that replicates and pushes objects proactively, and unlike previous approaches, takes full advantage of NDN routing and caching features. We compare the proposed strategy with default NDN mechanisms regarding content availability, consumer perfor- mance, and network overhead. The evaluation results indicate that our strategy can increase the hit rate of objects by at least 46% and reduce their retrieval time by over 60%, while not adding significant overhead"
