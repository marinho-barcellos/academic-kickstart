 abstract = {Reliable sender-based one-to-many protocols do not scale well\ndue mainly to implosion caused by excessive rate of feedback packets\narriving from receivers. We show that this problem can be circumvented\nby making the sender poll the receivers at carefully planned timingâˆ‹nstants, so that the arrival rate of feedback packets is not large\nenough to cause implosion. We describe a generic end-to-end protocol\nwhich incorporates this polling scheme together with error and flow\ncontrol mechanisms. We analyze the behavior of our protocol using\nsimulations which indicate that our scheme can be effective in\nminimizing losses due to implosion, achieving high throughput with low\nnetwork cost.},
