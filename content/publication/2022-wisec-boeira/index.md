abstract: "The expansion of mobile network capabilities throughout the decades has increased people's exposure to the digital world, and the next generations of communication networks are expected to achieve ubiquitous connectivity and immersive use cases. Security and privacy concerns have arisen and are continuously taken into account in the design of mobile networks. However, a relevant limitation currently lies in the use of shared secrets for providing security and privacy to users. Ideally, we believe that users' identities should be immune to impersonation as long as their own devices remain secure, notwithstanding the network operators and other entities potentially being compromised. In this paper, we develop this idea with the objective of providing the non-repudiation property, which represents a mitigation to its dual, impersonation."
