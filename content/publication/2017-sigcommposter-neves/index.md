abstract: "This paper describes the design and implementation of a general-purpose compile-time sandbox for P4 data plane programs. Our mechanism allows a supervisor to interpose on another program's interaction with the forwarding device. The sandboxing technique we use provides also a powerful new program structuring model, allowing a data plane developer to combine crosscutting program modules in a safe way. To demonstrate the capabilities of our construct, we describe the implementation of a data plane security kernel that enforces end host isolation policies on top of a programmable data plane."
