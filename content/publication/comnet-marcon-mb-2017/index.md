abstract: "Performance interference has been a well-known problem in datacenters and one that remains a constant topic of discussion in the literature. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) may enable the development of a robust solution for interference, as it allows dynamic control over resources through programmable in- terfaces and flow-based management. However, to date, the scalability of existing SDN-based approaches is limited, because of the number of entries required in flow tables and delays introduced. In this paper, we propose Predictor, a scheme to scalably address performance interference in SDN-based datacenter networks (DCNs), providing minimum bandwidth guarantees for applications and work-conservation for providers. Two novel SDN-based algorithms are proposed to address performance interference. Scalability is improved in Predictor as follows: first, it minimizes flow table size by controlling flows at application- level ; second, it reduces flow setup time by proactively installing rules in switches. We conducted an extensive evaluation, in which we verify that Predictor provides ( i ) guaranteed and predictable network performance for applications and their tenants; ( ii ) work-conserving sharing for providers; and ( iii ) sig- nificant improvements over DevoFlow (the state-of-the-art SDN-based proposal for DCNs), reducing flow table size (up to 94%) and having similar controller load and flow setup time."
