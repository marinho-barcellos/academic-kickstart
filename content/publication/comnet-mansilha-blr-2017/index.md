abstract: "The Information-centric network (ICN) is a novel architecture identifying data as a first class citizen, and caching as a prominent low-level feature. Yet, efficiently using large storage (e.g., 1TB) at line rate (e.g., 10 Gbps) is not trivial: in our previous work, we proposed an ICN router design equipped with hierarchi- cal caches, that exploits peculiarities of the ICN traffic arrival process. In this paper, we implement this proposal in the NDN Forwarding Daemon (NFD), and carry on a thorough experimental evaluation of its performance with an emulation methodology on common off the shelf hardware. Our study testifies to the interest and feasibility of the approach. Â©2017"
