### Teaching Awards

In Brazil, there is typically one graduation ceremony per semester, with students graduating in Computer Science or Computer Engineering programs. Each of these undergraduate programs select, by vote, two professors they considered the best/most influential in their 4-5 years of study. This is a very prestigious distinction, specially when the faculty is in the order of 60-70 professors and lecturers. I have been fortunate enough to be awarded several times in my career, spanning different higher-education institutions.

- **Best Lecturer**: Computer Science, [UFRGS](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/site/en/), class of 2017/1
