Although widely used, it is so far unclear how prevalent the different types of communities are and the degree to which the different traffic engineering actions have been used. There are two major reasons for this gap: few community values have been standardised and the limited visibility at route collectors. In this paper, leveraging the fact that Internet eXchange Points (IXPs) have sets of well-documented BGP communities, we use their BGP Looking Glasses (LGs) to inspect their route servers and shed light on how IXP members are using action BGP commu- nities. During twelve weeks, we collected and analysed routing data from eight IXPs worldwide, focusing the analysis on the four largest IXPs. We observe that i) over one-third of IXP members (35.7%) use action communities in at least one route; ii) two-thirds (66.6%) of them are intended to avoid propagating routes, mostly to content providers (CPs); iii) nearly one-third (31.8%) are targeting Autonomous Systems (ASes) that are not present at the IXPs’ route servers, resulting in no practical routing effect and only increasing processing and memory storage overheads.","tags":["BGP Communities","IXPs"],"title":"Light, Camera, Actions: characterizing the usage of IXPs' action BGP communities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christopher Lorier","Matthew Luckie","Marinho Barcellos","Richard Nelson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648771200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648771200,"objectID":"51cee3a945d742ea002f7671335fc5be","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2022-networking-lorier/","publishdate":"2022-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-networking-lorier/","section":"publication","summary":"Having a consistent application stack for hardware from multiple vendors allows operators to build simpler, more stable networks. However, due to the limitations of low cost, fixed-function networking hardware, creating portable controlplane software with current SDN standards requires accepting limited functionality, navigating inconsistent implementations, or using powerful, flexible hardware that is prohibitively expensive in many scenarios.\nThis paper describes Shoehorn, a system for creating portable SDN control-plane software for low cost hardware. Shoehorn allows control-plane software to define a hardware-agnostic virtual pipeline in P4 that can be algorithmically translated to control diverse low-cost hardware without a significant impact on memory usage or the rate that tables can be updated.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of Shoehorn, we created virtual pipelines for a variety of existing control-plane software, and mapped them to low cost hardware. We found that the virtual pipelines could be supported by hardware from multiple vendors in almost all cases.","tags":["SDN","p4"],"title":"Shoehorn: Towards Portable P4 for Low Cost Hardware","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fabricio Mazzola","Pedro Marcos","Ignacio Castro","Matthew Luckie","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"ebc19443a6908e59c199f2818959077a","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2022-pam-mazzola/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-pam-mazzola/","section":"publication","summary":"Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) play an essential role in the Internet, providing a fabric for thousands of Autonomous Systems (ASes) to interconnect. Initially designed to keep local traffic local, IXPs now interconnect ASes all over the world, and the premise that IXP routes should be shorter and faster than routes through a transit provider may not be valid anymore. Using BGP views from eight IXPs (three in Brazil, two in the U.S., and one each in London, Amsterdam, and Johannesburg), a transit connection at each of these locations, and latency measurements we collected in May 2021, we compare the latency to reach the same addresses using routes from remote peers, local peers, and transit providers. For four of these IXPs, at least 71.4% of prefixes advertised by remote peers also had a local peering route, BGP generally preferred the remote route due to its shorter AS path, but the local route had lower latency than the remote route in the majority of cases. When a remote route was the only peering route available at an IXP, it had slightly lower latency than a corresponding transit route available outside the IXP for 57.6% of the prefixes for seven of the eight IXPs.","tags":["Remote Peering","IXPs","BGP"],"title":"On the Latency Impact of Remote Peering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicu Florin Zaicu","Matthew Luckie","Richard Nelson","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1636329600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636329600,"objectID":"6ec069fd8d44b88c246d66f249dfc051","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2021-sosr-zaicu/","publishdate":"2021-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-sosr-zaicu/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent trends in software-defined networking have extended network programmability to the data plane through programming languages such as P4.

However, as any other type of software, P4 programs are subject to bugs and misconfigurations. Network verification tools have been proposed as a means of ensuring that the network behaves as expected, but these tools frequently face severe scalability issues. In this paper, we argue for a novel approach to this problem. Rather than statically inspecting a network configuration looking for bugs, we propose to enforce networking properties at runtime. To this end, we developed P4box, a system for deploying runtime monitors in programmable data planes. P4box allows programmers to easily express a broad range of properties (both program-specific and network-wide). Moreover, we provide an automated framework based on assertions and symbolic execution for ensuring monitor correctness. Our experiments on a SmartNIC show that P4box monitors represent a small overhead to network devices in terms of latency, throughput and power consumption.","tags":["p4","programmable data planes","enforcement"],"title":"Dynamic Property Enforcement in Programmable Data Planes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Marcos","Lars Prehn","Lucas Leal","Alberto Dainotti","Anja Feldmann","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1603756800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1603756800,"objectID":"2873efb36a730fae158df200a105e768","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2020-imc-marcos/","publishdate":"2020-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-imc-marcos/","section":"publication","summary":"Inbound traffic engineering (ITE)—the process of announcing routes to, e.g., maximize revenue or minimize congestion—is an essential task for Autonomous Systems (ASes). AS Path Prepending (ASPP) is an easy to use and well-known ITE technique that routing manuals show as one of the first alternatives to influence other ASes’ routing decisions.We observe that origin ASes currently prepend more than 25% of all IPv4 prefixes. ASPP consists of inflating the BGP AS path. Since the length of the AS path is the second tie-breaker in the BGP best path selection, ASPP can steer traffic to other routes. Despite being simple and easy to use, the appreciation of ASPP among operators and researchers is diverse. Some have questioned its need, effectiveness, and predictability, as well as voiced security concerns. Motivated by these mixed views, we revisit ASPP. Our longitudinal study shows that ASes widely deploy ASPP, and its utilization has slightly increased despite public statements against it. We surprisingly spot roughly 6k ASes originating at least one prefix with prepends that achieve no ITE goal. With active measurements, we show that ASPP effectiveness as an ITE tool depends on the AS location and the number of available upstreams; that ASPP security implications are practical; identify that more than 18% of the prepended prefixes contain unnecessary prepends that achieve no apparent goal other than amplifying existing routing security risks. We validate our findings in interviews with 20 network operators.","tags":["ASPP","BGP","Internet Security"],"title":"AS-Path Prepending: there is no rose without a thorn","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Muller","Matthew Luckie","Bradley Huffaker","Kimberly C Claffy","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1596240000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596240000,"objectID":"6b1ddb9ba913831c6fc34929151b974e","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2020-comnet-muller/","publishdate":"2020-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-comnet-muller/","section":"publication","summary":"An optional shortened abstract.","tags":["IP Spoofing","IXP","Internet measurements"],"title":"Spoofed Traffic Inference at IXPs: Challenges, Methods and Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Marcos","Marco Chiesa","Christoph Dietzel","Marco Canini","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579046400,"objectID":"4d26bc69c4398055e5ee09e7f7017713","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2020-ccr-marcos/","publishdate":"2019-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-ccr-marcos/","section":"publication","summary":"An optional shortened abstract.","tags":["Peering","IXP"],"title":"A Survey on the Current Internet Interconnection Practices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Muller","Matthew Luckie","Bradley Huffaker","Kimberly C Claffy","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575849600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575849600,"objectID":"281daaff019a131bf0c711668639235a","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2019-conext-muller/","publishdate":"2019-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-conext-muller/","section":"publication","summary":"An optional shortened abstract.","tags":["IP Spoofing","IXP","Internet measurements"],"title":"Challenges in Inferring Spoofed Traffic at IXPs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marinho Barcellos, Kirill Levchenko, Guofei Gu, Bradley Huffaker, Weverton Cordeiro, Luciano Paschoal Gaspary, Alberto Egon Schaeffer-Filho, Eduardo Alchieri, Jacir Bordim, João Gondim, Stenio Fernandes"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"ced69876e50643616d550d8072ff46f8","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/_projects/p4sec-rnp-nsf/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/_projects/p4sec-rnp-nsf/","section":"_projects","summary":" Recent advances in Software Defined Networking (SDN) have expanded our ability to program the network to its data plane. Through domain specific languages like P4, network operators can quickly deploy new protocols on forwarding devices, customize their functionality, and develop innovative services. This flexibility comes however with a cost: network-wide security and correctness properties (e.g., isolation, reachability, etc.) become much harder to ensure, because network behavior is now determined by a combination of the control plane-driven configuration and the data plane program that resides on devices (also called switches). Existing network verification tools, which rely on a fixed, invariant model of the data plane, are inadequate for programmable data planes.\nIn our P4Sec project, we research new techniques to verify and enforce security properties in data plane networks. The verification techniques we work on extend existing verification tools by automatically generating a data plane model from a P4 program. We also work on adapting existing verification tools to integrate with our dynamically-generated models to verify network configuration updates issued by an SDN controller. We also research novel approaches to ensure that network security properties are satisfied by a network configuration that is based on data plane enforcement. We work to develop an in-line monitor, implemented in the data plane itself, that enforces critical security properties, such as isolation and bandwidth limits, even in the presence of a faulty user data plane program or controller.

In addi- tion, NFV provides flexibility as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) can be moved to different locations in the network. One of the major chal- lenges of NFV is the allocation of demanded network services in the network infrastructures, commonly referred to as the Network Functions Virtualization - Resource Allocation (NFV-RA) problem. NFV-RA is divided into three stages: (i) Service Function Chain (SFC) composition, (ii) SFC embedding and (iii) SFC scheduling. Up to now, existing NFV- RA approaches have mostly tackled the SFC embedding stage taking the SFC composition as an assumption. Few approaches have faced the com- position of the SFCs using heuristic approaches that do not guarantee optimal solutions.

However, multi-resource allocation is APX-Hard and, consequently, providers simplify it by (i) allocating computing resources according to slots (which leads to fragmentation); and (ii) allowing the network to be shared in a best-effort manner (which leads to performance interference among applications). Recent efforts cannot minimize multi-resource fragmentation and, at the same time, provide guaranteed network performance. In this paper, we introduce Packer, a scheme that aims at minimizing multi-resource frag- mentation and providing predictable and guaranteed network performance with work-conservation. Packer employs a novel allocation strategy that (a) extends previous heuristics developed for multi-dimensional bin packing; and (b) uses as input a new abstraction, called Time-Interleaved Multi-Resource Abstraction (TI-MRA), for specifying temporal multi-resource requirements of applications. It also leverages Software-Defined Networking to dynamically enforce bandwidth guarantees and to provide work- conserving sharing. Since Packer brings more benefits if temporal requirements are specified, it is better suited for applications that present a predefined behavior, repeatedly running the same type of tasks with similar input sizes and data sets (such as PageRank and traffic analysis). Results show that, in comparison to the state- of-the-art, acceptance ratio is increased, datacenter utilization is improved (i.e., fragmentation is minimized), provider revenue is augmented and applications achieve predictable and guaranteed network performance with work-conservation, with the cost of taking more (yet acceptable) time to allocate applications.","tags":null,"title":"Packer:

intra-cloud network is typically shared in a best-effort manner, which causes tenant applications to have no actual bandwidth guarantees. Recent proposals address this issue either by statically reserving a slice of the physical infrastructure for each application or by providing proportional sharing among flows. The former approach results in overprovisioned network resources, while the latter requires substantial management overhead. In this paper, we introduce a resource allocation strategy that aims at providing an efficient way to predictably share bandwidth among applications and at minimizing resource underutilization while maintaining low management overhead. To demonstrate the benefits of the strategy, we develop IoN- Cloud, a system that implements the proposed allocation scheme. IoNCloud employs the abstraction of attraction/repulsion among applications according to their temporal bandwidth demands in order to group them in virtual networks. In doing so, we explore the trade-off between high resource utilization (which is desired by providers to achieve economies of scale) and strict network guarantees (necessary for tenants to run jobs predictably). Evaluation results show that IoNCloud can (a) provide predictable network sharing; and (b) reduce allocated bandwidth, resource underutilization and management overhead when compared against state-of-the-art proposals.

The relevance of this problem has led to a range of proposals, including physical distribution of controller instances and delegation of concerns to forwarding devices. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an architecture that leverages cellular data networks (4G) as control plane backup links. No previous work has explored this idea, despite the recent research intersecting SDN and wireless networks. Our experiments answer three research questions: (i) How is the behavior of control plane traffic affected by the characteristics of cellular links, (ii) how quickly is the control plane handed over to the backup link when a failure occurs and (iii) how well do network functions that rely on a snapshot of the network state behave on such an architecture. Our evaluation shows that, despite the expected higher latency of cellular links, this architecture maintains partial functionality of tasks that depend on global network awareness when failures occur in primary links in a simple, affordable fashion.

Our work explores the simple yet effective idea of supporting and exploiting such relations in CCN. In this paper, we present CCNrel as a backward-compatible mechanism for CCN that enables publishers to distribute contents as related objects. Differently from existing relation mechanisms, which focus on one type of content and are application-specific, CCNrel is generic and enables the use of relations in both current and novel application domains. First, we discuss CCNrel fundamental concepts and main design aspects. Next, we use CCNrel as foundation for a case study of data redundancy elimination in multimedia content distribution. Through extensive simulation work we evaluate the potential benefits of leveraging relations measured by the clients experience and overall network efficiency.

With respect to security, confidentiality and privacy mechanisms have become essential in light of recent discoveries related to pervasive electronic surveillance. In this paper we propose a heuristic method for virtual network embedding with security support. The method features precise modeling of overhead costs of security mechanisms and handles incoming requests in an online manner. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison between the proposed heuristic and an optimization model based on the same problem.

This is caused by the exhaustion of resources in certain key points of the infrastructure. In this paper, we propose HIPER - a strategy for expanding physical networks that suggests infrastructure upgrades with the objective of maximizing the acceptance of virtual network requests (and, as a consequence, physical resource utilization). This is achieved through the reconnection of strongly connected components (i.e., recurring partitions) of the infrastructure. Evaluated under realistic workloads, HIPER led to promising results. After the expansion of 10% to 20% of infrastructure resources, HIPER sustained an increase of up to 30% in virtual network acceptance, allowing an additional 52% in resource utilization.

To avoid single-point-of-failure, controller architectures are usually implemented as distributed systems. In this context, recent literature identified fundamental issues, such as device isolation and controller overload, and proposed controller placement strategies to tackle them. However, current proposals have crucial limitations: (i) device-controller connectivity is modeled using single paths, yet in practice multiple concurrent connections may occur; (ii) peaks in the arrival of new flows are only handled on-demand, assuming that the network itself can sustain high request rates; and (iii) failover mechanisms require predefined information, which, in turn, has been overlooked. This paper proposes Survivor, a controller placement strategy that addresses these challenges. The strategy explicitly considers path diversity, capacity, and failover mechanisms at network design. Compar- isons to the state-of-the-art on survivable controller placement show that Survivor is superior because (a) path diversity increases the survivability significantly; and (b) capacity-awareness is essential to handle overload during both normal and failover states.

One of the research challenges addressed recently in the literature is the efficient mapping of virtual resources on physical infrastructures. Although this challenge has received considerable attention, state-of-the-art approaches present, in general, a high rejection rate, i.e., the ratio between the number of denied virtual network requests and the total amount of requests is considerably high. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the quality of virtual network mappings and the topological structures of the underlying substrates. Exact solutions of an online embedding model are evaluated under different classes of network topologies. The obtained results demonstrate that the employment of physical topologies that contain regions with high connectivity significantly contributes to the reduction of rejection rates and, therefore, to improved resource usage.

High capacity physical links, in particular, constitute good targets since they may be important for a large number of virtual networks. Previous work protects virtual networks by setting aside backup resources. Although effective, this solution increases the cost to infrastructure providers. In this paper, we present a virtual network embedding approach which enables resilience to attacks and efficiency in resource utilization. Our approach is two-folded: while a preventive strategy embeds virtual links into multiple substrate paths, a reactive strategy attempts to reallocate any capacity affected by an underlying DoS attack. Since the embedding problem is NP-Hard, we devise a Simulated Annealing meta-heuristic to solve it efficiently. Results show our solution can provide resilience to attacks at a lower cost.

To tackle this problem, we propose a generic pollution control strategy and instantiate it as a mechanism for BitTorrent communities. The strategy follows a conservative approach: it regards newly published content as polluted, and allows the dissemination rate to increase according to the proportion of positive feedback issued about the content. In contrast to related approaches, the strategy and mechanism avoid the problem of pollution dissemination at the initial stages of a swarm, when insufficient feedback is available to form a reputation about the content. To evaluate the proposed solution, we conducted a set of experiments using a popular BitTorrent agent and an implementation of our mechanism.

In a previous paper, we have shown that vulnerabilities can be exploited to launch Denial-of-Service attacks against BitTorrent swarms, which can substantially increase download times and network traffic. In this paper, we review the three most damaging attacks, and propose two algorithms as countermeasures to effectively tackle them.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to evaluate the impact of attacks that exploit BitTorrent vulnerabilities with the sole intention of harming a swarm. The paper sheds light on BitTorrent behavior by presenting state diagrams, describes two attacks, and then evaluates their negative impact in realistic swarm settings.

The stability of the Internet depends on the congestion control being performed by this protocol, as well as equivalent mechanisms employed by other protocols. The ECN technique (Explicit Congestion Notification), in which packets forwarded by routers are marked whenever congestion is about to occur (or already occurring), allows a transmitter to reduce the sending rate accordingly without relying on packet drops. ECN has not been fully explored, particularly regarding multicast protocols. This paper presents models of poll-based reliable multicast protocols and extends them with a new single-rate congestion control mechanism that harnesses ECN.

In some of the anticipated future Grid applications, the same data will be transmitted to multiple sites. It is widely accepted that this can be, in theory, best achieved using reliable multicast protocols. This paper addresses the use of reliable multicast in Grid computing, identifying applications and requirements, and discussing how these requirements are met by the main protocols being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The emphasis of the study is on high-performance computing and communication, and on 1-N reliable multicast using the NACK Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol family. The two existing implementations are evaluated and compared with TCP, in scenarios that require 1-N transmission of data with a deadline. Unlike other work, our conclusions are backed by experimental evaluation of existing protocols in production environments. Therefore, the results shown portray the range of performance and cost that will be obtained if Grid applications are to embrace reliable multicast. The evaluation shows that NORM protocols can greatly reduce the network overhead incurred in 1-N transfers using TCP, but currently fail to satisfy the high-throughput requirements of the Grid. © 2005 IEEE.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating high-throughput reliable multicast for grid applications in production networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juliano da Silva","Luciano P Gaspary","Marinho Barcellos","Andre Detsch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"a41abd0123b6f42b7f3fc908ec081db9","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2005-grid-silva/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:03:23.710922Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2005-grid-silva/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Policy-based access control in peer-to-peer grid systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maziar Nekovee","Marinho Barcellos","Michael Daw"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"0ce9cbbde86af88ac8666b5eae6b336d","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2005-philosophical-nekovee/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:03:23.711441Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2005-philosophical-nekovee/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reliable multicast for the Grid: a case study in experimental computer science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marinho Barcellos","Maziar Nekovee","Michael Daw"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1099267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1099267200,"objectID":"2be8bc43c5e691073ba1116b1f0b64de","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/2004-grid-barcellos/","publishdate":"2019-12-10T00:03:23.714046Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2004-grid-barcellos/","section":"publication","summary":"Grid computing can be characterized as a distributed infrastructure that joins computing resources of multiple organizations together and enables the effective collaboration among researchers and engineers.

So, recent multicast protocols have been devised following the receiver-initiated approach: scalability (in terms of control traffic, protocol state and end-systems processing requirements) is achieved by making the sender independent from receivers; the sender does not know the membership of the destination group. However, this comes with a cost: the lack of knowledge about and control of receivers at the sender has negative implications with respect to throughput, network cost (bandwidth required), and degree of reliability offered to applications. This thesis follows an alternative approach: instead of adopting the receiver-initiated scheme, it greatly enhances the scalability of the sender-initiated scheme, by means of polling-based feedback and hierarchy. The resulting protocol is named PRMP: polling-based Reliable Multicast protocol. Its unique implosion avoidance mechanism polls receivers at carefully planned timing instants achieving a low and uniformly distributed rate of feedback packets. The sender retains controls of receivers: the main PRMP mechanisms are based on a one-to-many sliding window mechanism, which efficiently and elegantly extends the abstraction from reliable unicasting to reliable multicasting. The error control mechanism of PRMP incorporates the use of NACKs and selective, cumulative acknowledgment of packets; additionally, it can wait and judiciously decide between multicast and selective unicast retransmissions. The flow control mechanism prevents unnecessary losses caused by the overrunning of receivers, despite variations in round-trip times and application speeds. The scalability provided by the polling mechanism is further extended by an hierarchic organization to exploit distributed processing and local recovery: receivers are organized according to a tree-structure. However, unlike other tree-based protocols, PRMP is 'fully-hierarchic': each parent node forwards data via multicast to its children, and retains/explores the control of and knowledge about its children while autonomously applying error, flow, congestion and session controls in the communication with them. Two congestion control mechanisms, one window-based and another rate-based, have been incorporated to PRMP. As shown through simulation experiments, the resulting protocol achieves high though put with cost- effective reliable multicasting. They also show the scalability and effectiveness of PRMP mechanisms. PRMP can achieve reliable multicast with the same kind of reliability guarantees provided by TCP but without incurring prohibitive costs in terms of network cost or recovery latency found in other protocols.","tags":["IP multicast","feedback implosion problem","transport protocols"],"title":"PRMP: A Scaleable Polling-based Reliable Multicast Protocol","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marinho Barcellos","Valdir Belmonte Filho","João Schramm","Cláudio Geyer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":780969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":780969600,"objectID":"6f86340d2aa8c4e4fff994f16473a1c8","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/1994-osr-barcellos/","publishdate":"1994-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/1994-osr-barcellos/","section":"publication","summary":"An optional shortened abstract.","tags":["distributed operating systems","heterogeneity"],"title":"The HetNOS network operating system: a tool for writing distributed applications","type":"publication"}]
