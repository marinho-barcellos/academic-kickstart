Through domain specific languages like P4, network operators can quickly deploy new protocols on forwarding devices, customize their functionality, and develop innovative services. This flexibility comes however with a cost: network-wide security and correctness properties (e.g., isolation, reachability, etc.) become much harder to ensure, because network behavior is now determined by a combination of the control plane-driven configuration and the data plane program that resides on devices (also called switches). Existing network verification tools, which rely on a fixed, invariant model of the data plane, are inadequate for programmable data planes.\nIn our P4Sec project, we research new techniques to verify and enforce security properties in data plane networks. The verification techniques we work on extend existing verification tools by automatically generating a data plane model from a P4 program. We also work on adapting existing verification tools to integrate with our dynamically-generated models to verify network configuration updates issued by an SDN controller. We also research novel approaches to ensure that network security properties are satisfied by a network configuration that is based on data plane enforcement. We work to develop an in-line monitor, implemented in the data plane itself, that enforces critical security properties, such as isolation and bandwidth limits, even in the presence of a faulty user data plane program or controller.

The proposed scheme uses cryptographic primitives and mobility awareness to enable location proofs that work also in high-speed scenarios. Vouch+ takes a decentralized approach to establish trust in location information, but can also be used with future 5G infrastructure. The evaluation of Vouch+ using a synthetic dataset from the city of Cologne shows that using a decentralized approach is viable for cases where traffic is dense enough. In addition, simulation-based experiments show that Vouch+ is able to handle the high-mobility environment of vehicular networks and can counteract studied position-based attacks using reaction strategies.","tags":null,"title":"Decentralized proof of location in vehicular Ad Hoc networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Miguel Neves","Bradley Huffaker","Kirill Levchenko","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"5681871a905225e4774c21776c3faffc","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/networking-neves-2019/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.10991Z","relpermalink":"/publication/networking-neves-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Network programmers can currently deploy an arbitrary set of protocols in forwarding devices through data plane programming languages such as P4.

In this paper, we argue for a novel approach to this problem. Rather than statically inspecting a network configuration looking for bugs, we propose to enforce networking properties at runtime. To this end, we developed P4box, a system for deploying runtime monitors in programmable data planes. Our results show that P4box allows programmers to easily express a broad range of properties.

In this paper, we investigate how these attacks can be detected using Vouch location proof scheme (by identifying false location messages) and propose several reaction strategies to mitigate them.

Given that Internet eXchange Points provide increasingly more peering choices, rudimen- tary schemes for picking interconnection partners are not adequate anymore. Although the current interconnection ecosystem is shrouded in confidentiality, our key observation is that recently emerged blockchain technology and advances in cryptography enable a privacy-preserving decentralized solution based on actual performance measurements.

Autonomous Systems (ASes) can now reach hundreds of networks directly through Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). Despite the benefits, any pair of ASes needs first to agree on exchanging traffic. By survey-ing 100+ network operators, we discovered that this process is mainly manual and lengthy. Because of the hassle, ASes miss interconnection opportunities and prefer long-term agree-ments, even if not matching current Internet traffic dynamics. To facilitate establishing agreements in short time frames, we propose Dynam-IX, a framework that arms operators with two components: a high-level interconnection intent abstrac-tion, which allows them to express their interconnection poli-cies, and a protocol to automate discovering and offering interconnection opportunities. Dynam-IX provides a trust-worthy environment where networks agree to interconnect without relying on any central entity. To realize this, we use a blockchain infrastructure to allow operators to query for inter-connection proposals and securely store agreement records. We evaluate a prototype built atop Hyperledger Fabric and show that an AS can establish tens of agreements within a minute, unleashing possibilities for traffic engineering, in-creasing link utilization and creating economic opportunities.

Software-Defined Networking (SDN) may enable the development of a robust solution for interference, as it allows dynamic control over resources through programmable in- terfaces and flow-based management. However, to date, the scalability of existing SDN-based approaches is limited, because of the number of entries required in flow tables and delays introduced. In this paper, we propose Predictor, a scheme to scalably address performance interference in SDN-based datacenter networks (DCNs), providing minimum bandwidth guarantees for applications and work-conservation for providers.

Recent efforts cannot minimize multi-resource fragmentation and, at the same time, provide guaranteed network performance. In this paper, we introduce Packer, a scheme that aims at minimizing multi-resource frag- mentation and providing predictable and guaranteed network performance with work-conservation. Packer employs a novel allocation strategy that (a) extends previous heuristics developed for multi-dimensional bin packing; and (b) uses as input a new abstraction, called Time-Interleaved Multi-Resource Abstraction (TI-MRA), for specifying temporal multi-resource requirements of applications. It also leverages Software-Defined Networking to dynamically enforce bandwidth guarantees and to provide work- conserving sharing. Since Packer brings more benefits if temporal requirements are specified, it is better suited for applications that present a predefined behavior, repeatedly running the same type of tasks with similar input sizes and data sets (such as PageRank and traffic analysis). Results show that, in comparison to the state- of-the-art, acceptance ratio is increased, datacenter utilization is improved (i.e., fragmentation is minimized), provider revenue is augmented and applications achieve predictable and guaranteed network performance with work-conservation, with the cost of taking more (yet acceptable) time to allocate applications.","tags":null,"title":"Packer: Minimizing multi-resource fragmentation and performance interference in datacenters","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas Freire","Miguel Neves","Alberto Schaeffer-Filho","Marinho Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"04f49e2e2068da78502b5695a1d0a89e","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/ccs-freire-nfb-2017/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.074405Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ccs-freire-nfb-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Current trends in SDN extend network programmability to the data plane through the use of programming languages such as P4.

However, providers lack mechanisms to provide fair and predictable bandwidth sharing among al- located applications, enabling selfish and malicious tenants to cause performance interference in the net- work (and denial of service in an extreme case). Such interference results in poor and unpredictable net- work performance for well-behaved applications. Recent research has proposed techniques that ( i ) cannot protect tenants against interference; ( ii ) result in under utilization of resources; or ( iii ) add substantial management overhead. In this paper, we describe a resource allocation strategy that aims at providing predictable network performance (i.e., minimizing performance interference) with bandwidth guarantees for tenant applications, while maintaining high network utilization and low management overhead. These benefits are achieved by grouping applications from mutually trusting users into logically isolated do- mains (virtual infrastructures - VIs) with bandwidth guarantees, while also considering the amount of traffic generated by applications. Despite the benefits, grouping may lead to fragmentation (i.e., available resources are dispersed among VIs and some requests may be unnecessarily declined). Therefore, we also study the associated trade-off (grouping to increase isolation versus resource fragmentation). To illus- trate the feasibility of grouping applications inside VIs, we develop PredCloud, a system that implements the proposed strategy on SDN/OpenFlow-enabled networks. Through an extensive evaluation, we show that PredCloud significantly reduces performance interference and application exposure to attacks, while maintaining low resource fragmentation. Furthermore, provider revenue can be increased by efficiently managing and charging network resources.","tags":null,"title":"PredCloud: Providing predictable network performance in large-scale OpenFlow-enabled cloud platforms through trust-based allocation of resources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Leonardo Richter Bays","Rodrigo Ruas Oliveira","Luciana S Buriol","Marinho Pilla Barcellos","Luciano Paschoal Gaspary"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1462060800,"objectID":"f84961a2ced6d5107246dc059e25a402","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/comcom-bays-2016/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.112283Z","relpermalink":"/publication/comcom-bays-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Network virtualization has become increasingly popular in recent years.

One of the research challenges addressed recently in the lit- erature is the efficient mapping of virtual resources on physical infrastructures. Although this challenge has received considerable attention, state-of-the-art approaches present, in general, a high rejection rate, i.e., the ratio between the number of denied virtual network requests and the total amount of requests is considerably high. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the quality of virtual network mappings and the topological structures of the underlying substrates. Exact solutions of an online em- bedding model are evaluated under different classes of ISP and datacenter network topologies. The obtained results demonstrate that the employment of physical topologies that contain regions with high connectivity significantly contributes to the reduction of rejection rates and, therefore, to improved re- source usage. Additionally, through an extensive analysis of denied requests, we assess the main rejec- tion causes related to both ISP and datacenter networks and provide strong evidence of each one. In summary, through the embedding of virtual requests, available resources in ISP networks tend to be more partitioned in comparison to datacenter networks.

Our experiments answer three research questions: (i) How is the behavior of control plane traffic affected by the characteristics of cellular links, (ii) how quickly is the control plane handed over to the backup link when a failure occurs and (iii) how well do network functions that rely on a snapshot of the network state behave on such an architecture. Our evaluation shows that, despite the expected higher latency of cellular links, this architecture maintains partial functionality of tasks that depend on global network awareness when failures occur in primary links in a simple, affordable fashion.

A piece of content is represented by a single object in the network and is divided into multiple chunks which can be uniquely named and cached by network nodes. However, in its current form, the potential of CCN is not fully exploited due to the lack of common means to express and take advantage from possible relations that may exist among different objects. Our work explores the simple yet effective idea of supporting and exploiting such relations in CCN. In this paper, we present CCNrel as a backward-compatible mechanism for CCN that enables publishers to distribute contents as related objects. Differently from existing relation mechanisms, which focus on one type of content and are application-specific, CCNrel is generic and enables the use of relations in both current and novel application domains. First, we discuss CCNrel fundamental concepts and main design aspects. Next, we use CCNrel as foundation for a case study of data redundancy elimination in multimedia content distribution. Through extensive simulation work we evaluate the potential benefits of leveraging relations measured by the clients experience and overall network efficiency. Results of the presented use case show that, on average and when compared to default CCN operations, content download times are improved in 34%, publishers load in 56%, and the network bandwidth usage in 43","tags":null,"title":"CCNrel: Leveraging relations among objects to improve the performance of CCN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pedro Garc$\u0008ackslash$'$\u0008ackslash$ia López","Alberto Montresor","Dick H J Epema","Anwitaman Datta","Teruo Higashino","Adriana Iamnitchi","Marinho P Barcellos","Pascal Felber","Etienne Rivière"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"1d83cfdbf8daf3bca77048f6ce7a3bbc","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/ccr-lopez-medhibfr-2015/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.090259Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ccr-lopez-medhibfr-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"In many aspects of human activity, there has been a con- tinuous struggle between the forces of centralization and decentralization.

We position that a new shift is necessary. Technological advances such as powerful dedicated connec- tion boxes deployed in most homes, high capacity mobile end-user devices and powerful wireless networks, along with growing user concerns about trust, privacy, and autonomy requires taking the control of computing applications, data, and services away from some central nodes (the “core”) to the other logical extreme (the “edge”) of the Internet. We also position that this development can help blurring the boundary between man and machine, and embrace social computing in which humans are part of the computation and decision making loop, resulting in a human-centered system design.

One of its main advantages is the use of isolation to limit the scope of attacks – that is, avoiding traf- fic from one virtual network to interfere with the others. However, virtual networks are still vulnerable to disruptions on the underlying network. Particularly, high capacity physical links constitute good targets since they may be important for a large number of virtual networks. Previous work protects virtual networks by setting aside backup resources. Although effective, this kind of solution tends to be expensive, as backup resources increase the cost to infras- tructure providers and usually remain idle. This paper presents ORE (opportunistic resilience embedding), a novel embedding approach for protecting virtual links against substrate net- work disruptions. ORE's design is two-fold: while a proactive strategy embeds each virtual link into multiple substrate paths in order to mitigate the initial impact of a disruption, a reactive one attempts to recover any capacity affected by an underlying disruption. Both strategies are modeled as optimization problems. Additionally, since the embedding problem is NP-Hard, ORE uses a simulated annealing-based meta-heuristic to solve it efficiently.

By shifting dedicated, hardware-based network function processing to software running on commoditized hard- ware, NFV has the potential to make the provisioning of network functions more flexible and cost-effective, to mention just a few anticipated benefits. Despite consistent initial efforts to make NFV a reality, little has been done towards efficiently placing virtual network functions and deploying service function chains (SFC). With respect to this particular research problem, it is important to make sure resource allocation is carefully performed and orchestrated, preventing over- or under-provisioning of resources and keeping end-to-end delays comparable to those observed in traditional middlebox-based networks. In this paper, we formalize the network function placement and chaining problem and propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to solve it. Additionally, in order to cope with large infrastructures, we propose a heuristic procedure for efficiently guiding the ILP solver towards feasible, near-optimal solutions. Results show that the proposed model leads to a reduction of up to 25% in end-to-end delays (in comparison to chainings observed in traditional infrastructures) and an acceptable resource over- provisioning limited to 4%. Further, we demonstrate that our heuristic approach is able to find solutions that are very close to optimality while delivering results in a timely manner.","tags":["NFV"],"title":"Piecing Together the NFV Provisioning Puzzle: Efficient Placement and Chaining of Virtual Network Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel S Marcon","Marinho Pilla Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"00e59076e8beb1ebb83bc7835a715141","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/im-marcon-2015-a/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.091611Z","relpermalink":"/publication/im-marcon-2015-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can simplify traffic management in large-scale datacenter networks (DCNs). On one hand, it provides a robust method to address the challenge of performance interference (bandwidth sharing unfairness) in DCNs. On the other, its pragmatic implementation based on OpenFlow introduces scalability challenges, as it (a) adds latency for new flows (the controller must process hundreds of thousands of requests per second and install appropriate rules in switches); and (b) requires large flow tables in devices (DCNs can have more than 16 million distinct flows per second with different requirements and duration). To employ OpenFlow-based SDN in DCNs, recent work has proposed techniques that require hardware customization to keep up with the high dynamic traffic patterns of these networks. We make two key observations: providers do not need to control each flow individually (e.g., VM-to-VM), since they charge tenants based on the amount of resources consumed by applications; and congestion control in the intra-cloud network is expected to be proportional to the tenant's payment. Based on these insights, we introduce Predictor, a novel system for DCNs that enables fine-grained network management for providers, minimizes flow table size by controlling flows at application-layer and reduces flow setup time by proactively installing rules in switches. It also enables tenants to request and receive predictable network performance for both intra- and inter-application communication, with work- conserving bandwidth sharing. Evaluation results show that Predictor provides significant improvements against DevoFlow (reducing flow table size up to 87%) and offers predictable and guaranteed network performance for tenants.

Since descriptions are of paramount importance to enable users to find contents, non-moderated CDS are clearly vulnerable to malicious interferences and susceptible to content pollution. Furthermore, colluding attackers may flood the system with imprecise metadata and turn the system into a useless content distribution platform. To protect the system from massive malicious behaviors and provide better Quality- of-Experience (QoE) to users, this paper presents a novel con- servative strategy to mitigate collusion attacks in non-moderated CDS.

CDS may be classified in two groups. The first group (moderated) comprises the set of systems in which contents are checked against their descriptions before being published. The second group (non-moderated) is the set of systems without any kind of moderation. Since descriptions are of paramount importance to enable users to find contents, non-moderated CDS are clearly vulnerable to malicious interferences and susceptible to content pollution. Furthermore, colluding attackers may flood the system with imprecise metadata and turn the system into a useless content distribution platform. To protect the system from massive malicious behaviors and provide better Qualityof-Experience (QoE) to users, this paper presents a novel conservative strategy to mitigate collusion attacks in non-moderated CDS. The rationale behind this simple, yet very effective strategy, is to delay user's actions and randomly authorize them. Results indicate that this “artificial delay” reduces the effect of attackers in the system and, hence, increases user's QoE.

In this paper, we review the three most damaging attacks, and propose two algorithms as countermeasures to effectively tackle them. We implemented the attacks and countermeasures in a packet-level BitTorrent simulator. The results indicate that our proposed approach is effective when there is an ongoing attack while at the same time efficient when the countermeasure is active but there is no attack.

The stability of the Internet depends on the congestion control being performed by this protocol, as well as equivalent mechanisms employed by other protocols. The ECN technique (Explicit Congestion Notification), in which packets forwarded by routers are marked whenever congestion is about to occur (or already occurring), allows a transmitter to reduce the sending rate accordingly without relying on packet drops. ECN has not been fully explored, particularly regarding multicast protocols. This paper presents models of poll-based reliable multicast protocols and extends them with a new single-rate congestion control mechanism that harnesses ECN. Simulation results show that it provides fairness between flows from multiple sources, and is TCP-friendly. Further, they demonstrate the substantial efficiency gain obtained with the use of ECN in multicast.","tags":null,"title":"Congestion control with ECN support in poll-based multicast protocols","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marinho P.

In some of the anticipated future Grid applications, the same data will be transmitted to multiple sites. It is widely accepted that this can be, in theory, best achieved using reliable multicast protocols. This paper addresses the use of reliable multicast in Grid computing, identifying applications and requirements, and discussing how these requirements are met by the main protocols being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The emphasis of the study is on high-performance computing and communication, and on 1-N reliable multicast using the NACK Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol family. The two existing implementations are evaluated and compared with TCP, in scenarios that require 1-N transmission of data with a deadline. Unlike other work, our conclusions are backed by experimental evaluation of existing protocols in production environments. Therefore, the results shown portray the range of performance and cost that will be obtained if Grid applications are to embrace reliable multicast. The evaluation shows that NORM protocols can greatly reduce the network overhead incurred in 1-N transfers using TCP, but currently fail to satisfy the high-throughput requirements of the Grid. © 2005 IEEE.","tags":null,"title":"Evaluating high-throughput reliable multicast for grid applications in production networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juliano F da Silva","Luciano Paschoal Gaspary","Marinho P Barcellos","André Detsch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"ee472b18a60a13560cfea2da3a8b0727","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/grid-silva-gbd-2005/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.086208Z","relpermalink":"/publication/grid-silva-gbd-2005/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Policy-based access control in peer-to-peer grid systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M Nekovee","Marinho Pilla Barcellos","M Daw"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"e063a68147251738180ff313b19286e9","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/philosophical-nekovee-2005/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.127016Z","relpermalink":"/publication/philosophical-nekovee-2005/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reliable multicast for the Grid: a case study in experimental computer science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marinho Pilla Barcellos","Maziar Nekovee","Michael Daw"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1099267200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1099267200,"objectID":"1432d1e47769a7ae3b9b8c6e2583464d","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/grid-barcellos-2004/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.131218Z","relpermalink":"/publication/grid-barcellos-2004/","section":"publication","summary":"Grid computing can be characterized as a distributed infrastructure that joins computing resources of multiple organizations together and enables the effective collaboration among researchers and engineers.

This paper proposes P2PSLF (Peer-to-Peer Security Layer Framework), a flexible security framework for peer-to-peer based grid computing. P2PSLF provides a wide range of security mechanisms (e.g., authentication, confidentiality, integrity, authorization, and audit), and allows the creation of new ones. It is independent of the overlying application, which enables new systems to be implemented without having to deal with security issues within the application. In addition, the framework is modular and reconfigurable. The set of security requirements to be satisfied in communications is determined per peer, and can be changed without recompiling the application. The framework is exercised using OurGrid, a P2P-based middleware that enables the creation of a multi-organization grid computing environment for the execution of bag-of-tasks applications.

Simmcast, based on Java, allows simulated protocols to be specified using a multi-threaded, object-oriented framework; building blocks are combined in order to create new protocol simulation experiments. To help validating Simmcast, two reliable multicast protocols used in a well-known analytical study were simulated and the results achieved compared the ones produced by Simmcast. In Simmcast, users are first presented an easy-to-understand, abstract multicast protocol simulation model, and then can gradually increase the level of detail in their simulation. Unlike existing tools, Simmcast provides a flexible simulation model which is dedicated to the design and evaluation of multicast protocols.","tags":null,"title":"Simmcast: a Simulation Tool for Multicast Protocol Evaluation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Congyue Liu","Paul D Ezhilchelvan","Marinho Pilla Barcellos"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":941414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":941414400,"objectID":"3bcefa16e9dc9ed674a30de84ee073cc","permalink":"https://marinho-barcellos.github.io/publication/ngc-liu-1999/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T08:31:06.132907Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ngc-liu-1999/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Multicast Transport Protocol for Reliable Group Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.P.
