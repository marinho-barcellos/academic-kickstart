 abstract = {Reliable sender-based one-to-many protocols do not scale well$\backslash$ndue mainly to implosion caused by excessive rate of feedback packets$\backslash$narriving from receivers. We show that this problem can be circumvented$\backslash$nby making the sender poll the receivers at carefully planned timing$\backslash$ninstants, so that the arrival rate of feedback packets is not large$\backslash$nenough to cause implosion. We describe a generic end-to-end protocol$\backslash$nwhich incorporates this polling scheme together with error and flow$\backslash$ncontrol mechanisms. We analyze the behavior of our protocol using$\backslash$nsimulations which indicate that our scheme can be effective in$\backslash$nminimizing losses due to implosion, achieving high throughput with low$\backslash$nnetwork cost.},
