 abstract = {The Internet topology has significantly changed in the past years. Today, it is richly connected and flattened. Such a change has been driven mostly by the fast growth of peering infrastructures and the expansion of Content Delivery Networks as alternatives to reduce interconnection costs and improve traffic delivery performance. While the topology evolution is perceptible, it is unclear whether or not the interconnection process has evolved or if it continues to be an ad-hoc and lengthy process. To shed light on the current practices of the Internet interconnection ecosystem and how these could impact the Internet, we surveyed more than 100 network operators and peering coordinators. We divide our results into two parts:(i)(i) the current interconnection practices, including the steps of the process and the reasons to establish new interconnection agreements or to renegotiate existing ones, and the parameters discussed by network operators. In part (ii)(ii), we report the existing limitations and how the interconnection ecosystem can evolve in the future. We show that despite the changes in the topology, interconnecting continues to be a cumbersome process that usually takes days, weeks, or even months to complete, which is in stark contrast with the desire of most operators in reducing the interconnection setup time. We also identify that even being primary candidates to evolve the interconnection process, emerging on-demand connectivity companies are only fulfilling part of the existing gap between the current interconnection practices and the network operators' desires.},

abstract = {Future cooperative transportation systems will be highly dependent on correct situation awareness that can be established with the help of inter-vehicular communication. Location information from surrounding vehicles will most likely be used in such systems to make automated driving decisions, making it essential to guarantee location assurance. In this paper we propose Vouch+, which provides a scheme to improve trustworthiness of shared location information. The proposed scheme uses cryptographic primitives and mobility awareness to enable location proofs that work also in high-speed scenarios. Vouch+ takes a decentralized approach to establish trust in location information, but can also be used with future 5G infrastructure. The evaluation of Vouch+ using a synthetic dataset from the city of Cologne shows that using a decentralized approach is viable for cases where traffic is dense enough. In addition, simulation-based experiments show that Vouch+ is able to handle the high-mobility environment of vehicular networks and can counteract studied position-based attacks using reaction strategies.},

abstract = {Network programmers can currently deploy an arbitrary set of protocols in forwarding devices through data plane programming languages such as P4. However, as any other type of software, P4 programs are subject to bugs and misconfigurations. Network verification tools have been proposed as a means of ensuring that the network behaves as expected, but these tools typically require programmers to manually model P4 programs, are limited in terms of the properties they can guarantee and frequently face severe scalability issues. In this paper, we argue for a novel approach to this problem. Rather than statically inspecting a network configuration looking for bugs, we propose to enforce networking properties at runtime. To this end, we developed P4box, a system for deploying runtime monitors in programmable data planes. Our results show that P4box allows programmers to easily express a broad range of properties. Moreover, we demonstrate that runtime monitors represent a small overhead to network devices in terms of latency and resource consumption.},

Given that Internet eXchange Points provide increasingly more peering choices, rudimen- tary schemes for picking interconnection partners are not adequate anymore. Although the current interconnection ecosystem is shrouded in confidentiality, our key observation is that recently emerged blockchain technology and advances in cryptography enable a privacy-preserving decentralized solution based on actual performance measurements.

We use the prototype implemented to show the gains provided by three speed up techniques (use of constraints, program slicing, par- allelization), and experiment with different compiler optimization choices.

In this paper, we investigate how these attacks can be detected using Vouch location proof scheme (by identifying false location messages) and propose several reaction strategies to mitigate them.

abstract = {Internet connectivity is changing. Autonomous Systems (ASes) can now reach hundreds of networks directly through Internet eXchange Points (IXPs). Despite the benefits, any pair of ASes needs first to agree on exchanging traffic. By survey-ing 100+ network operators, we discovered that this process is mainly manual and lengthy. Because of the hassle, ASes miss interconnection opportunities and prefer long-term agree-ments, even if not matching current Internet traffic dynamics. To facilitate establishing agreements in short time frames, we propose Dynam-IX, a framework that arms operators with two components: a high-level interconnection intent abstrac-tion, which allows them to express their interconnection poli-cies, and a protocol to automate discovering and offering interconnection opportunities. Dynam-IX provides a trust-worthy environment where networks agree to interconnect without relying on any central entity. To realize this, we use a blockchain infrastructure to allow operators to query for inter-connection proposals and securely store agreement records. We evaluate a prototype built atop Hyperledger Fabric and show that an AS can establish tens of agreements within a minute, unleashing possibilities for traffic engineering, in-creasing link utilization and creating economic opportunities.

abstract = {Performance interference has been a well-known problem in datacenters and one that remains a constant topic of discussion in the literature. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) may enable the development of a robust solution for interference, as it allows dynamic control over resources through programmable in- terfaces and flow-based management. However, to date, the scalability of existing SDN-based approaches is limited, because of the number of entries required in flow tables and delays introduced. In this paper, we propose Predictor, a scheme to scalably address performance interference in SDN-based datacenter networks (DCNs), providing minimum bandwidth guarantees for applications and work-conservation for providers. Two novel SDN-based algorithms are proposed to address performance interference. Scalability is improved in Predictor as follows: first, it minimizes flow table size by controlling flows at application- level ; second, it reduces flow setup time by proactively installing rules in switches. We conducted an extensive evaluation, in which we verify that Predictor provides ( i ) guaranteed and predictable network performance for applications and their tenants; ( ii ) work-conserving sharing for providers; and ( iii ) sig- nificant improvements over DevoFlow (the state-of-the-art SDN-based proposal for DCNs), reducing flow table size (up to 94%) and having similar controller load and flow setup time.},

abstract = {Named-Data Networking (NDN) is a promising architectural approach that focuses on the efficient distribution of data objects. Each of these objects represents an individual piece of content that is uniquely named and can be cached by network nodes. Recent work on Information-Centric Networking (ICN) explores new uses of the data object concept to enable advanced applications based on content distribution. Such work includes the use of metadata and manifests to describe contents as sets of multiple correlated objects. In this paper, we extend our previous work on a model and a backward-compatible mechanism, named NDNrel, that allows publishers to distribute contents as related objects. The new version of NDNrel reduces the cost of distributing relation information to clients by leveraging the usage of metadata and manifests on ICN architectures. Also, it considers additional aspects such as the authentication of relations and data that comprise the content. The evaluation of NDNrel is revisited and extended to analyze the performance and overhead caused by the usage of the proposed relation model in two scenarios: distribution of multimedia and Web content. Results demonstrate that using NDNrel to structure the contents as objects and relations outperforms default NDN, reducing the average client download time and the global network traffic in at least 28% and 34% respectively.},

In addi- tion, NFV provides flexibility as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) can be moved to different locations in the network. One of the major chal- lenges of NFV is the allocation of demanded network services in the network infrastructures, commonly referred to as the Network Functions Virtualization - Resource Allocation (NFV-RA) problem. NFV-RA is divided into three stages: (i) Service Function Chain (SFC) composition, (ii) SFC embedding and (iii) SFC scheduling. Up to now, existing NFV- RA approaches have mostly tackled the SFC embedding stage taking the SFC composition as an assumption. Few approaches have faced the com- position of the SFCs using heuristic approaches that do not guarantee optimal solutions.

abstract = {—Cloud applications perform rich and complex tasks, with time-varying demands for multiple types of resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O and network). However, multi-resource allocation is APX-Hard and, consequently, providers simplify it by (i) allocating computing resources according to slots (which leads to fragmentation); and (ii) allowing the network to be shared in a best-effort manner (which leads to performance interference among applications). Recent efforts cannot minimize multi-resource fragmentation and, at the same time, provide guaranteed network performance. In this paper, we introduce Packer, a scheme that aims at minimizing multi-resource frag- mentation and providing predictable and guaranteed network performance with work-conservation. Packer employs a novel allocation strategy that (a) extends previous heuristics developed for multi-dimensional bin packing; and (b) uses as input a new abstraction, called Time-Interleaved Multi-Resource Abstraction (TI-MRA), for specifying temporal multi-resource requirements of applications. It also leverages Software-Defined Networking to dynamically enforce bandwidth guarantees and to provide work- conserving sharing. Since Packer brings more benefits if temporal requirements are specified, it is better suited for applications that present a predefined behavior, repeatedly running the same type of tasks with similar input sizes and data sets (such as PageRank and traffic analysis). Results show that, in comparison to the state- of-the-art, acceptance ratio is increased, datacenter utilization is improved (i.e., fragmentation is minimized), provider revenue is augmented and applications achieve predictable and guaranteed network performance with work-conservation, with the cost of taking more (yet acceptable) time to allocate applications.},

abstract = {This paper studies the impact of vulnerabilities associated with the Sybil attack (through falsification of multiple identities) and message falsification in vehicular platooning. Platooning employs Inter-Vehicular Communication (IVC) to control a group of vehicles. It uses broadcast information such as acceleration, position, and velocity to operate a longitudinal control law. Cooperation among vehicles allows platoons to re- duce fuel consumption and risks associated with driver mistakes. In spite of these benefits, the use of network communication to control vehicles exposes a relevant attack surface that can be exploited by malicious actors. To carry out this study, we evaluate five scenarios to quantify the potential impact of such attacks, identifying how platoons behave under varying Sybil attack conditions and what are the associated safety risks. This research also presents the use of location hijacking attack. In this attack, innocent vehicles that are not part of a platoon are used as a way to create trust bond between the false identities and the physical vehicles. We demonstrate that the ability to create false identities increases the effectiveness of message falsification attacks by making them easier to deploy and harder to detect in time. I.},

abstract = {Network virtualization has become increasingly popular in recent years. It has the potential to allow timely handling of network infrastructure requests and, after instantiated, their lifecycle. In addition, it enables improved physical resource utilization. However, the use of network virtualization in large-scale, real environments depends on the ability to adequately map virtual routers and links to physical re- sources, as well as to protect virtual networks against security threats. With respect to security, mecha- nisms supporting confidentiality and privacy have become essential in light of recent discoveries related to pervasive electronic surveillance. In this paper we propose a set of tools to efficiently embed virtual networks with privacy support and to allow their real instantiation on top of SDN/OpenFlow-based sub- strates. This toolset unfolds into three main contributions: (a) an exact VNE model suitable for smaller networks, which also serves the purpose of determining an optimality baseline; (b) a heuristic VNE algo- rithm, which features precise modeling of overhead costs of security mechanisms and handles incoming requests in an online manner; and (c) a VNE to SDN/OpenFlow translation mechanism, which takes as input the outcome of the heuristic VNE algorithm and produces a set of coherent OpenFlow rules to guide the real instantiation of the mapped virtual networks. We present a detailed performance com- parison between the proposed heuristic and the optimization model. The obtained results demonstrate that the heuristic algorithm is able to find feasible mappings in the order of seconds even when deal- ing with large network infrastructures. Finally, we demonstrate how mappings generated by our heuristic VNE},

abstract = {Cloud computing allows tenants to run a wide range of applications without any upfront capital invest- ment. However, providers lack mechanisms to provide fair and predictable bandwidth sharing among al- located applications, enabling selfish and malicious tenants to cause performance interference in the net- work (and denial of service in an extreme case). Such interference results in poor and unpredictable net- work performance for well-behaved applications. Recent research has proposed techniques that ( i ) cannot protect tenants against interference; ( ii ) result in under utilization of resources; or ( iii ) add substantial management overhead. In this paper, we describe a resource allocation strategy that aims at providing predictable network performance (i.e., minimizing performance interference) with bandwidth guarantees for tenant applications, while maintaining high network utilization and low management overhead. These benefits are achieved by grouping applications from mutually trusting users into logically isolated do- mains (virtual infrastructures - VIs) with bandwidth guarantees, while also considering the amount of traffic generated by applications. Despite the benefits, grouping may lead to fragmentation (i.e., available resources are dispersed among VIs and some requests may be unnecessarily declined). Therefore, we also study the associated trade-off (grouping to increase isolation versus resource fragmentation). To illus- trate the feasibility of grouping applications inside VIs, we develop PredCloud, a system that implements the proposed strategy on SDN/OpenFlow-enabled networks. Through an extensive evaluation, we show that PredCloud significantly reduces performance interference and application exposure to attacks, while maintaining low resource fragmentation. Furthermore, provider revenue can be increased by efficiently managing and charging network resources.},

By relying on the ICT infrastructure and on Internet connectivity, these so-called Smart Grids are now able to provide new functionalities and to become more efficient. However, despite the existence of a few standards that aim to specify the secure operation of Smart Grids, utility companies do not have a comprehensive set of metrics and evaluation tools for assessing security properties in these infrastructures. Thus, it is necessary to develop new toolsets to provide support for vulnerability analysis in Smart Grids. This paper proposes ASTORIA, a framework developed to allow the simulation of attacks and the evaluation of their impact on Smart Grid infrastructures, using closely-related real devices and real topologies comprising both power grid elements as well as ICT and networking equipment. We anticipate that ASTORIA can be used by Smart Grid operators not only to analyze the impact of malicious attacks and other security threats in different components, but also to permit the development and evaluation of anomaly detection techniques in a simulation environment. Further, we present evaluation scenarios illustrating customizable Smart Grid topologies, comprising sensors, master and remote stations, and using an extensible set of attack profiles.},

abstract = {Network virtualization is a mechanism that allows the coexistence of multiple virtual networks on top of a single physical substrate. Due to its well-known potential benefits (e.g., lower CAPEX/OPEX ex- penditures), it has been embraced by the IT sector, specially by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and cloud computing/datacenter companies. One of the research challenges addressed recently in the lit- erature is the efficient mapping of virtual resources on physical infrastructures. Although this challenge has received considerable attention, state-of-the-art approaches present, in general, a high rejection rate, i.e., the ratio between the number of denied virtual network requests and the total amount of requests is considerably high. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the quality of virtual network mappings and the topological structures of the underlying substrates. Exact solutions of an online em- bedding model are evaluated under different classes of ISP and datacenter network topologies. The obtained results demonstrate that the employment of physical topologies that contain regions with high connectivity significantly contributes to the reduction of rejection rates and, therefore, to improved re- source usage. Additionally, through an extensive analysis of denied requests, we assess the main rejec- tion causes related to both ISP and datacenter networks and provide strong evidence of each one. In summary, through the embedding of virtual requests, available resources in ISP networks tend to be more partitioned in comparison to datacenter networks. Such differences on partitioning levels lead to a different percentage of rejection causes in each topology class. &},

abstract = {Network Virtualization promotes the development of new architectures and protocols by en- abling the creation ofmultiple virtual networks on top of the same physical substrate. One of its main advantages is the use of isolation to limit the scope of attacks – that is, avoiding traf- fic from one virtual network to interfere with the others. However, virtual networks are still vulnerable to disruptions on the underlying network. Particularly, high capacity physical links constitute good targets since they may be important for a large number of virtual networks. Previous work protects virtual networks by setting aside backup resources. Although effective, this kind of solution tends to be expensive, as backup resources increase the cost to infras- tructure providers and usually remain idle. This paper presents ORE (opportunistic resilience embedding), a novel embedding approach for protecting virtual links against substrate net- work disruptions. ORE's design is two-fold: while a proactive strategy embeds each virtual link into multiple substrate paths in order to mitigate the initial impact of a disruption, a reactive one attempts to recover any capacity affected by an underlying disruption. Both strategies are modeled as optimization problems. Additionally, since the embedding problem is NP-Hard, ORE uses a simulated annealing-based meta-heuristic to solve it efficiently. Numerical results show that ORE can provide resilience to disruptions at a lower cost.},

abstract = {—Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is a promis- ing network architecture concept, in which virtualization tech- nologies are employed to manage networking functions via software as opposed to having to rely on hardware to handle these functions. By shifting dedicated, hardware-based network function processing to software running on commoditized hard- ware, NFV has the potential to make the provisioning of network functions more flexible and cost-effective, to mention just a few anticipated benefits. Despite consistent initial efforts to make NFV a reality, little has been done towards efficiently placing virtual network functions and deploying service function chains (SFC). With respect to this particular research problem, it is important to make sure resource allocation is carefully performed and orchestrated, preventing over- or under-provisioning of resources and keeping end-to-end delays comparable to those observed in traditional middlebox-based networks. In this paper, we formalize the network function placement and chaining problem and propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model to solve it. Additionally, in order to cope with large infrastructures, we propose a heuristic procedure for efficiently guiding the ILP solver towards feasible, near-optimal solutions. Results show that the proposed model leads to a reduction of up to 25% in end-to-end delays (in comparison to chainings observed in traditional infrastructures) and an acceptable resource over- provisioning limited to 4%. Further, we demonstrate that our heuristic approach is able to find solutions that are very close to optimality while delivering results in a timely manner.},

We also position that this development can help blurring the boundary between man and machine, and embrace social computing in which humans are part of the computation and decision making loop, resulting in a human-centered system design.

abstract = {Software-Defined Networking (SDN) can simplify traffic management in large-scale datacenter networks (DCNs). On one hand, it provides a robust method to address the challenge of performance interference (bandwidth sharing unfairness) in DCNs. On the other, its pragmatic implementation based on OpenFlow introduces scalability challenges, as it (a) adds latency for new flows (the controller must process hundreds of thousands of requests per second and install appropriate rules in switches); and (b) requires large flow tables in devices (DCNs can have more than 16 million distinct flows per second with different requirements and duration). To employ OpenFlow-based SDN in DCNs, recent work has proposed techniques that require hardware customization to keep up with the high dynamic traffic patterns of these networks. We make two key observations: providers do not need to control each flow individually (e.g., VM-to-VM), since they charge tenants based on the amount of resources consumed by applications; and congestion control in the intra-cloud network is expected to be proportional to the tenant's payment. Based on these insights, we introduce Predictor, a novel system for DCNs that enables fine-grained network management for providers, minimizes flow table size by controlling flows at application-layer and reduces flow setup time by proactively installing rules in switches. It also enables tenants to request and receive predictable network performance for both intra- and inter-application communication, with work- conserving bandwidth sharing. Evaluation results show that Predictor provides significant improvements against DevoFlow (reducing flow table size up to 87%) and offers predictable and guaranteed network performance for tenants.

A piece of content is represented by a single object in the network and is divided into multiple chunks which can be uniquely named and cached by network nodes. However, in its current form, the potential of CCN is not fully exploited due to the lack of common means to express and take advantage from possible relations that may exist among different objects. Our work explores the simple yet effective idea of supporting and exploiting such relations in CCN. In this paper, we present CCNrel as a backward-compatible mechanism for CCN that enables publishers to distribute contents as related objects. Differently from existing relation mechanisms, which focus on one type of content and are application-specific, CCNrel is generic and enables the use of relations in both current and novel application domains. First, we discuss CCNrel fundamental concepts and main design aspects. Next, we use CCNrel as foundation for a case study of data redundancy elimination in multimedia content distribution. Through extensive simulation work we evaluate the potential benefits of leveraging relations measured by the clients experience and overall network efficiency. Results of the presented use case show that, on average and when compared to default CCN operations, content download times are improved in 34%, publishers load in 56%, and the network bandwidth usage in 43},

abstract = {Software Defined Networks simplify network pro- grammability by detaching the control plane from forwarding devices and deploying it into a logically centralized controller. While this allows a clearer separation of concerns, it also creates a dependency between them. Failures in the control plane break the controller view of the network state and could render the network unusable if forwarding devices cannot be reached. The relevance of this problem has led to a range of proposals, including physical distribution of controller instances and delegation of concerns to forwarding devices. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an architecture that leverages cellular data networks (4G) as control plane backup links. No previous work has explored this idea, despite the recent research intersecting SDN and wireless networks. Our experiments answer three research questions: (i) How is the behavior of control plane traffic affected by the characteristics of cellular links, (ii) how quickly is the control plane handed over to the backup link when a failure occurs and (iii) how well do network functions that rely on a snapshot of the network state behave on such an architecture. Our evaluation shows that, despite the expected higher latency of cellular links, this architecture maintains partial functionality of tasks that depend on global network awareness when failures occur in primary links in a simple, affordable fashion.

With minimum effort, however, an attacker can subvert this process, obtain a multitude of fake accounts, and use them for malicious purposes. Puzzle-based solutions have been proposed to limit the spread of fake accounts, by establishing a price (in terms of computing resources) per identity requested. Although effective, they do not distinguish between requests coming from pre- sumably legitimate users and potential attackers, and also lead to a significant waste of en- ergy and computing power. In this paper, we build on adaptive puzzles and complement them with waiting time to introduce a green design for lightweight, long-term identity management; it balances the complexity of assigned puzzles based on the reputation of the origin (source) of identity requests, and reduces energy consumption caused by puzzle- solving. We also take advantage of lessons learned from massive distributed computing to come up with a design that makes puzzle-processing useful. Based on a set of experiments, we show that our solution provides significant energy savings and makes puzzle-solving a useful task, while not compromising effectiveness in limiting the spread of fake accounts.},

abstract = {The intra-cloud network is typically shared in a best-effort manner, which causes tenant applications to have no actual bandwidth guarantees. Recent proposals address this issue either by statically reserving a slice of the physical infrastructure for each application or by providing proportional sharing among flows. The former approach results in overprovisioned network resources, while the latter requires substantial management overhead. In this paper, we introduce a resource allocation strategy that aims at providing an efficient way to predictably share bandwidth among applications and at minimizing resource underutilization while maintaining low management overhead. To demonstrate the benefits of the strategy, we develop IoN- Cloud, a system that implements the proposed allocation scheme. IoNCloud employs the abstraction of attraction/repulsion among applications according to their temporal bandwidth demands in order to group them in virtual networks. In doing so, we explore the trade-off between high resource utilization (which is desired by providers to achieve economies of scale) and strict network guarantees (necessary for tenants to run jobs predictably). Evaluation results show that IoNCloud can (a) provide predictable network sharing; and (b) reduce allocated bandwidth, resource underutilization and management overhead when compared against state-of-the-art proposals.

Although there have been efforts to solve it, we observe that a number of virtual network requests are rejected due to the exhaustion of resources only in key points of the infrastructure. In this paper, we propose an expansion strategy based on the reconnection of strongly connected components (partitions) of the infrastructure in order to suggest adjustments that lead to higher virtual network acceptance and, in consequence, to improved physical resource utilization. The obtained results evidence that an expansion of 10% to 20% of the infrastructure resources using the proposed strategy leads to a sustained increase of up to 30% in the number of accepted virtual networks and of up to 45% in resource usage compared to the original network.

abstract = {Network virtualization has become increasingly popular in recent years. It has the potential to allow timely handling of network infrastructure requests and, after instantiated, their lifecycle. In addition, it enables improved physical resource utilization. However, the use of network virtualization in large-scale, real environments depends on the ability to adequately map virtual routers and links to physical resources, as well as to protect virtual networks against security threats. With respect to security, confidentiality and privacy mechanisms have become essential in light of recent discoveries related to pervasive electronic surveillance. In this paper we propose a heuristic method for virtual network embedding with security support. The method features precise modeling of overhead costs of security mechanisms and handles incoming requests in an online manner. Additionally, we present a detailed performance comparison between the proposed heuristic and an optimization model based on the same problem. The obtained results demonstrate that the heuristic method is able to find feasible mappings in the order of seconds even when dealing with large network infrastructures, while the optimization model is limited to smaller networks.

Despite these efforts, current state-of-the-art proposals still suffer from significant amount of rejection of virtual network requests in circumstances where overall resource availability would be sufficient to embed them. This is caused by the exhaustion of resources in certain key points of the infrastructure. In this paper, we propose HIPER - a strategy for expanding physical networks that suggests infrastructure upgrades with the objective of maximizing the acceptance of virtual network requests (and, as a consequence, physical resource utilization). This is achieved through the reconnection of strongly connected components (i.e., recurring partitions) of the infrastructure. Evaluated under realistic workloads, HIPER led to promising results. After the expansion of 10% to 20% of infrastructure resources, HIPER sustained an increase of up to 30% in virtual network acceptance, allowing an additional 52% in resource utilization.

abstract = {In SDN, forwarding devices can only operate cor- rectly while connected to a logically centralized controller. To avoid single-point-of-failure, controller architectures are usually implemented as distributed systems. In this context, recent literature identified fundamental issues, such as device isolation and controller overload, and proposed controller placement strategies to tackle them. However, current proposals have crucial limitations: (i) device-controller connectivity is modeled using single paths, yet in practice multiple concurrent connections may occur; (ii) peaks in the arrival of new flows are only handled on-demand, assuming that the network itself can sustain high request rates; and (iii) failover mechanisms require predefined information, which, in turn, has been overlooked. This paper proposes Survivor, a controller placement strategy that addresses these challenges. The strategy explicitly considers path diversity, capacity, and failover mechanisms at network design. Compar- isons to the state-of-the-art on survivable controller placement show that Survivor is superior because (a) path diversity increases the survivability significantly; and (b) capacity-awareness is essential to handle overload during both normal and failover states.

One of the research challenges addressed recently in the literature is the efficient mapping of virtual resources on physical infrastructures. Although this challenge has received considerable attention, state-of-the-art approaches present, in general, a high rejection rate, i.e., the ratio between the number of denied virtual network requests and the total amount of requests is considerably high. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the quality of virtual network mappings and the topological structures of the underlying substrates. Exact solutions of an online embedding model are evaluated under different classes of network topologies. The obtained results demonstrate that the employment of physical topologies that contain regions with high connectivity significantly contributes to the reduction of rejection rates and, therefore, to improved resource usage.

Previous work protects virtual networks by setting aside backup resources. Although effective, this solution increases the cost to infrastructure providers. In this paper, we present a virtual network embedding approach which enables resilience to attacks and efficiency in resource utilization. Our approach is two-folded: while a preventive strategy embeds virtual links into multiple substrate paths, a reactive strategy attempts to reallocate any capacity affected by an underlying DoS attack.

abstract = {BitTorrent-based file sharing communities are very popular nowadays. Anecdotal evidence hints that such communi- ties are exposed to content pollution attacks (i.e., publication of ‘false' files, viruses, or other malware), requiring a moderation effort from their administrators. The size of such a cumber- some task increases with content publishing rate. To tackle this problem, we propose a generic pollution control strategy and instantiate it as a mechanism for BitTorrent communities. The strategy follows a conservative approach: it regards newly published content as polluted, and allows the dissemination rate to increase according to the proportion of positive feedback issued about the content. In contrast to related approaches, the strategy and mechanism avoid the problem of pollution dissemination at the initial stages of a swarm, when insufficient feedback is available to form a reputation about the content. To evaluate the proposed solution, we conducted a set of experiments using a popular BitTorrent agent and an implementation of our mechanism. Results indicate that the proposed approach mitigates the dissemination of polluted content in BitTorrent, imposing a low overhead in the distribution of non-polluted ones.},

In a previous paper, we have shown that vulnerabilities can be exploited to launch Denial-of-Service attacks against BitTorrent swarms, which can substantially increase download times and network traffic. In this paper, we review the three most damaging attacks, and propose two algorithms as countermeasures to effectively tackle them. We implemented the attacks and countermeasures in a packet-level BitTorrent simulator. The results indicate that our proposed approach is effective when there is an ongoing attack while at the same time efficient when the countermeasure is active but there is no attack. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal in the literature to make BitTorrent more robust against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

Its wide adoption has exposed some potential problems, like selfish peer behavior. Related research efforts so far have focused on modeling the dynamics of swarms, as well as devising incentive mechanisms that improve fairness without sacrificing efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to evaluate the impact of attacks that exploit BitTorrent vulnerabilities with the sole intention of harming a swarm. The paper sheds light on BitTorrent behavior by presenting state diagrams, describes two attacks, and then evaluates their negative impact in realistic swarm settings. To evaluate the impact of attacks, a discrete-event simulator was developed and validated against an experimental evaluation performed in a controlled environment. Our findings show the seriousness of the problem and should be the basis for the development of new mechanisms to increase BitTorrent security.},

The stability of the Internet depends on the congestion control being performed by this protocol, as well as equivalent mechanisms employed by other protocols. The ECN technique (Explicit Congestion Notification), in which packets forwarded by routers are marked whenever congestion is about to occur (or already occurring), allows a transmitter to reduce the sending rate accordingly without relying on packet drops. ECN has not been fully explored, particularly regarding multicast protocols. This paper presents models of poll-based reliable multicast protocols and extends them with a new single-rate congestion control mechanism that harnesses ECN. Simulation results show that it provides fairness between flows from multiple sources, and is TCP-friendly. Further, they demonstrate the substantial efficiency gain obtained with the use of ECN in multicast.},

In some of the anticipated future Grid applications, the same data will be transmitted to multiple sites. It is widely accepted that this can be, in theory, best achieved using reliable multicast protocols. This paper addresses the use of reliable multicast in Grid computing, identifying applications and requirements, and discussing how these requirements are met by the main protocols being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). The emphasis of the study is on high-performance computing and communication, and on 1-N reliable multicast using the NACK Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) protocol family. The two existing implementations are evaluated and compared with TCP, in scenarios that require 1-N transmission of data with a deadline. Unlike other work, our conclusions are backed by experimental evaluation of existing protocols in production environments. Therefore, the results shown portray the range of performance and cost that will be obtained if Grid applications are to embrace reliable multicast. The evaluation shows that NORM protocols can greatly reduce the network overhead incurred in 1-N transfers using TCP, but currently fail to satisfy the high-throughput requirements of the Grid. {\textcopyright} 2005 IEEE.},

P2PSLF provides a wide range of security mechanisms (e.g., authentication, confidentiality, integrity, authorization, and audit), and allows the creation of new ones. It is independent of the overlying application, which enables new systems to be implemented without having to deal with security issues within the application. In addition, the framework is modular and reconfigurable. The set of security requirements to be satisfied in communications is determined per peer, and can be changed without recompiling the application. The framework is exercised using OurGrid, a P2P-based middleware that enables the creation of a multi-organization grid computing environment for the execution of bag-of-tasks applications.

To help validating Simmcast, two reliable multicast protocols used in a well-known analytical study were simulated and the results achieved compared the ones produced by Simmcast. In Simmcast, users are first presented an easy-to-understand, abstract multicast protocol simulation model, and then can gradually increase the level of detail in their simulation. Unlike existing tools, Simmcast provides a flexible simulation model which is dedicated to the design and evaluation of multicast protocols.},

abstract = {Reliable sender-based one-to-many protocols do not scale well\ndue mainly to implosion caused by excessive rate of feedback packets\narriving from receivers. We show that this problem can be circumvented\nby making the sender poll the receivers at carefully planned timing\ninstants, so that the arrival rate of feedback packets is not large\nenough to cause implosion. We describe a generic end-to-end protocol\nwhich incorporates this polling scheme together with error and flow\ncontrol mechanisms. We analyze the behavior of our protocol using\nsimulations which indicate that our scheme can be effective in\nminimizing losses due to implosion, achieving high throughput with low\nnetwork cost.},
